# Hell0_TDD

**Project:** Hell0_TDD  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate Test-Driven Development (TDD) in C#  

## Overview

Hell0_TDD is a C# project designed to teach and showcase **TDD best practices**. The project will start with a **blank solution** and a **Core library**, and will be developed incrementally using **unit tests first**.  

This repository is structured to:

- [ ] Use **xUnit** for unit testing.  <!-- TODO -->
- [ ] Maintain a **Core library** for production code.  <!-- TODO -->
- [ ] Follow **conventional commits** for version control.  <!-- TODO -->
- [x] Be linked to GitHub for versioning and collaboration.  <!-- TODO -->

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio 2022**.  
3. All development will follow **TDD principles** — write tests first, then implement features.  

## Current Status

- Blank solution initialized.  
- `.gitignore` added for Visual Studio projects.  
- MIT license file included.  
- README file created.
